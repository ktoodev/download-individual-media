# Download Individual Media

Tiny (and basic) WordPress plugin to add media download links for admins as a convenience (just having the URL doesn't make the file easy to download for everyone). 

Currently adds download links:
- To the media library insert/edit media modal (via the `attachment_fields_to_edit` hook)
- As an inline link after the \[audio\] shortcode in the editor
